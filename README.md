# <FONT COLOR = "blue">***Tetris Game***</FONT>
It is a repository that contains the JavaScript source code to develop a Tetris game. This project is created to learn and strengthen my experience with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

This repository don't search anything, it is a repository for purely practical and educational purposes.

I hope upgrade my programming skills and learn a lot with this project.
